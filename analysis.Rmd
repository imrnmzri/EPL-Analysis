## Introduction

This project serves to learn about web scraping data using the rvest library and performing analysis on Premier League players on 2023/2024 season

```{r message=FALSE}

url <- "https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/stats/Premier-League-Stats#stats_standard"

# Use httr library to GET the url and convert the content as text
html_resp <- GET(url)
html <- content(html_resp, as = "text") %>% 
  str_remove_all("(<!--|-->)") %>% # Remove comments
  read_html() # Read the text as html

players <- html %>% 
  html_element("table#stats_standard") %>% # THE table to use
  html_table()

# Remove parent header and promote first row to header
colnames(players) <- players[1,]
players <- players[-1, ]

str(players)
```
